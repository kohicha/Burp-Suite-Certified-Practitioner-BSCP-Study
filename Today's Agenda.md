**My Recommendation for Your Focus:**

Given you have an interview tomorrow, I recommend prioritizing the topics that directly map to the OWASP Top 10 categories and have a good number of labs for hands-on practice.

**Top Priority:**

1. **SQL injection (18 Labs):** A03: Injection
2. **Access control (13 Labs):** A01: Broken Access Control
3. **Authentication (14 Labs):** A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
4. **Cross-site scripting (XSS) (30 Labs):** A03: Injection (highly prevalent and important)
5. **Server-side request forgery (SSRF) (7 Labs):** A10: Server-Side Request Forgery

**If you have extra time, also consider:**

6. **XXE injection (9 Labs):** A05: Security Misconfiguration
7. **Insecure deserialization (10 Labs):** A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
