# Broken Access Control
This is a type of vulnerability/weakness, that involves a user accessing something that they are not supposed to, usually, lacking privileges to do so. 
### Vertical access controls
Usually means that you are escalating your privileges to something hire, e.g, user -> moderator -> administrator.
### Horizontal access controls
It means that your are able to access an existing profile/user that has the same privileges as you, but has information that shouldn't be disclosed to the public.
e.g, user1 -> user2 
### Context-dependent access controls
It means that you are able to disrupt a flow of a functionality in the application, e.g, add to cart -> check out -> skip the payment -> product is out for shipping.
